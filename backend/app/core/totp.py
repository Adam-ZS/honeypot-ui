"""Time-based one-time passwords — RFC 6238.

Audit finding 9. The report lists MFA among the implemented Protect controls
in Tables III, VI and VIII. Login checked an email address and a password and
nothing else. The OTP machinery that existed served email verification at
signup and password reset — one-time account actions, not a second factor at
authentication.

TOTP rather than emailed codes, for a reason specific to this deployment:
SMTP is not configured, so an emailed second factor would lock every account
out the moment it was enforced. An authenticator app needs no delivery channel
at all, which makes this the one form of MFA that can actually be turned on
here.

Implemented against the RFC directly rather than adding a dependency — the
algorithm is HMAC-SHA1 over a counter, and the engine's dependency surface is
already carrying asyncssh for a reason it could not avoid.

The shared secret is stored encrypted at rest with the same AES-256-GCM used
for captured commands. A plaintext TOTP secret in the database is equivalent
to no second factor at all against anyone who reaches the database.
